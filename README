BSI CLI TOOLS
==============

Version 0.9 (BETA)

Cli tools to use Bigstep Infrastructure from the command line. 

PHP is needed to run this tool set. 

Usage:
./bsi <command>

Available commands:
=================
cluster_create              Create a cluster with a number of nodes with a specific configuration.
cluster_contract            Contract a cluster (i.e. reduce the number of nodes).
cluster_delete              Delete a cluster (keep the LUNS) to free resources.
cluster_expand              Expand a cluster (i.e. increase the number of nodes).
cluster_get                 Returns an description of a cluster.
cluster_get_ips             Returns the ips used by a cluster.
cluster_nodes               Returns the nodes contained by a cluster.
cluster_servers             Returns the servers used by the nodes of a cluster.
cluster_start               Starts a cluster from a stopped state.
cluster_stop                Stopps a cluster to free resources. Use it to restore it's state at a later time
infrastructure_clear        Deletes everything that can be deleted from an infrastructure.
infrastructure_create       Creates a new infrastructure. This infrastructure comes with associated WAN and SAN networks
infrastructure_deploy       Deployes the registered changes. Tp be used to start any operation registered. Use after any create, edit, delete command.
infrastructure_get          Retrieves information about the clusters, networks and LUNS of an infrastructure.
infrastructure_user_add     Adds a new user. The user will be an admin user but will not have any right. Use infrastructure_user_add to add it as a delegate to a specific infrastructure.
infrastructure_user_remove  Removes a delegate user from an infrastructure.
lan_create                  Create a LAN network inside an infrastructure.
lun_attach_to_node          Attach a LUN to a node.
lun_clone                   Clone a LUN to make a replica of it. This will also create a snapshot and the original LUN will no longer be deletable unless all clones are deleted.
lun_create                  Create a LUN of a specified size either empty block device or by cloning a template.
lun_delete                  Deletes a LUN
lun_expand                  Expand a LUN. This will expand the LUN on the storage device so that it has another size. It will also atempt to expand the FS on it using parted.
lun_get                     Displayes information about a LUN.
lun_snapshots               Retrieves the snapshots associated with a LUN.
lun_templates_get           Retrieves all the templates of a LUN.
network_create              Creates a network.
node_get                    Retrieves information about a node.
node_power_get              Retrieves the power status of a node.
node_power_off              Powers off a node.
node_power_on               Powers on a node.
resource_utilizations       Retrieves the resource utilization of a node
snapshot_create             Create snapshot of a LUN
snapshot_revert             Reverts a LUN to a snapshot.
user_get                    Retrieves data about a user.
user_infrastructures        Retrieves all infrastructures to which the user is a delegate.
user_ssh_key_upload         Set the PUBLIC SSH key to be configured on all servers and devices provisioned by the sistem for the current user.

===================
Example Usage
==================
To create a cluster with one node: 

### Create the infrastructure
# All assets are grouped into an infrastructure. A user can have multple infrastructures
#
#

:~/code/bsi-cli-tools $ ./bsi infrastructure_create test
array (
  'infrastructure_id' => 68,
  'user_id_owner' => 2,
  'infrastructure_label' => 'test',
  'infrastructure_description' => '',
  'infrastructure_ongoing_deployments_counter' => 0,
)

### Create a cluster for a single node with: 
# ProLiant DL320e Gen8 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1230 V2 @ 3.30GHz 16GB RAM 3,300Mhz
# Use Ubuntu 12 LTS template (the only one available at this time)
# A cluster has multple nodes and an infrastructure can hold multiple clusters that are connected by networks. 
#


:~/code/bsi-cli-tools $ ./bsi cluster_create 68 test_cluster 1 16 3300 1 4 ubuntu_12_LTS 
array (
  'cluster_id' => NULL,
  'cluster_label' => 'test_cluster',
  'cluster_ipv4_public_auto_create_and_allocate' => true,
  'cluster_node_count' => 1,
  'cluster_ram_gbytes' => 16,
  'cluster_processor_core_mhz' => 3300,
  'cluster_processor_count' => 1,
  'cluster_processor_core_count' => 4,
  'lun_template_id' => 2,
  'lun_storage_type' => 'iscsi_ssd',
)array (
  'cluster_id' => 44,
  'cluster_id_name' => 'cluster_44',
  'lun_template_id' => 2,
  'lun_storage_type' => 'iscsi_ssd',
  'cluster_label' => 'test_cluster',
  'cluster_node_count' => 1,
  'cluster_ipv4_public_auto_create_and_allocate' => true,
  'cluster_ram_gbytes' => 16,
  'cluster_processor_count' => 1,
  'cluster_processor_core_mhz' => 3300,
  'cluster_processor_core_count' => 4,
  'infrastructure_id' => 68,
  'cluster_service_status' => 'ordered',
  'cluster_type' => 'server',
  'current_operation' => 
  array (
    'cluster_id' => 44,
    'lun_template_id' => 2,
    'lun_storage_type' => 'iscsi_ssd',
    'cluster_configuration_name' => NULL,
    'cluster_node_count' => 1,
    'cluster_ipv4_public_auto_create_and_allocate' => true,
    'cluster_ram_gbytes' => 16,
    'cluster_processor_count' => 1,
    'cluster_processor_core_mhz' => 3300,
    'cluster_processor_core_count' => 4,
    'cluster_change_operation_type' => 'create',
    'cluster_change_deploy_status' => 'not_started',
  ),
)
 Don't forget you need to run infrastructure_deploy for the actual deployment


### Initialize provisioning.
# Provisioning is done asyncronously but only after a deploy call. 
# This allows the user to design the infrastructure before it is actually provisioned so that the entire operation set can be done in one sweep
#


~/code/bsi-cli-tools $ ./bsi infrastructure_deploy 68
Deploying changes
array (
  'infrastructure_id' => 68,
  'user_id_owner' => 2,
  'infrastructure_label' => 'test',
  'infrastructure_description' => '',
  'infrastructure_ongoing_deployments_counter' => 0,
)


Check status of provisioning operations

:~/code/bsi-cli-tools $ ./bsi infrastructure_get 68
